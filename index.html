              Welcome to Peace Voices, a place where youth speak up, share their experiences,
              and inspire peace across West Africa in the face of extremism. This project
              grows out of research on religious extremism and the impact of youth exchange
              programs like YES.

      <p class="text">
        <strong>Peace Voices is a project for GSTR 410: <br> Faith and Fanatics Religious Extremism at Home and Abroad </strong><br> It explores how youth, education, and exchange programs can reduce extremist recruitment in West Africa and promote peaceful coexistence.</p>
      <p class="text">
        Inspired by the YES (Youth Exchange and Study) Program—created after 9/11 to build bridges between cultures—this project reflects my experience as a YES 2017 alumnus from Senegal. Living in another culture taught me how understanding and dialogue can break stereotypes and inspire peace.</p>
      <p class="text">Peace Voices turns this idea into action by giving young people a space to share their voices, tell their stories, and stand together against extremism.</p>

      <!-- Mission section -->
      <h3 class="section-subtitle">Our Mission</h3>
      <p class="text">
        Our mission is simple yet powerful:
        to create a safe online space where young people can
        learn about the roots of extremism,
        share their own stories of peace,
        and explore solutions rooted in dialogue, education, and respect.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        By amplifying youth perspectives, <strong>Peace Voices</strong> reminds the world that peace begins with understanding — and that every voice matters.
